# Edit name and avatar

The app is working great, but if you were to share it with anyone, every single user would be logged in as you!

Let's fix that by giving the user the option to update their name and avatar. These inputs could also live on the welcome page.

You can use [AsyncStorage](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/asyncstorage/) to persist the data across app launches so the user would not have to type their name in every time.
