# Navigation

Our app currently has no navigation. All the interaction takes place on one page. In order to spread the app out to multiple pages, we'll need navigation.

If you remember, when you created you project with the expo cli, you had the choice of creating one with navigation already set up. You may choose to create a new project using the navigation template, or install it yourself.

There are two major players for navigation in React Native - [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) and [React Native Navigaion](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation). We will be using React Navigation, since that is supported by Expo.

In your project directory, run:

```
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

Then you can follow the [get started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html) tutorial.

Try creating a welcome page for the user.
